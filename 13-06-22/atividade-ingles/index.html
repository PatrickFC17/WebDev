            <h1 style="text-align: center">An Ordinary Day</h1>
            <p>I actually don't have a fixed hour to wake up on a non-lective day, because I go to sleep very late, usually at daybreak. So, I'll pick up a random time. Let's supose that I commonly wake up around 1p.m (considering that I go to sleep at 3a.m). To start my day there has to be coffee, so I go to the kitchen and take a large cup of coffee to really begin it. What happens after that is totally random and don't have any pattern. But there are a few possibilities: </p>
            <ol>
                  <li>I begin my programming session and stand in it untill I feel hungry or something.</li>
                  <li>I read something: a book, a mangá, a webtoon, a novel, anything.</li>
                  <li>I start a discord call in my group.</li>
                  <li>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold">Note: This one would enter in the first topic but I prefer to list it separately because it envolves work and not just dumb things I do for practice</span> <br>
                        I start working in the source code of the system I'm developing at work.
                  </li>
                  <li>I do absolutely nothing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Yeah, that's right. I don't actually have a social life, so I just do things that I like to spend time and sometimes I talk to my close friends at the discord group. At night it's generally the same thing, unless that I decide to watch some anime or movie and get something to eat. Theoretically speaking my day is, for someone watchig from the outside view, extremally boring and doesn't have anything special in it. But I like it and it's my routine, I like this way to live, doing the things I want to do and working on my things, studying my stuff and talking only to the people that matters to me. I think that's pretty much it.</p>
            <p>
                  Than I stick in this system untill it's very very late and I have to go to sleep (let's pretend it's at 3a.m). <br>
                  Well, I think that's it. Thanks for not falling asleep reading this.
            </p>
